  </ul>
  <p><b>Purpose(s) and Objective(s) of the Research:</b>
  <ul>
    <li> This study will investigate the usability and effectiveness of different visual comparison techniques in expert
      usage scenarios. The goal is to better understand how to design high-performance systems that involve visual
      comparison.
      </p>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Procedures:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>The session will require approximately 30 minutes, and will take place online using a custom web-based study
      system.</li>
    <li>If possible, you should take part in the study from a private and undisturbed location.</li>
    <li>In the study, you will be asked to carry out four tasks on a set of images or videos using one of three visual
      comparison techniques.</li>
    <li>At several points during the session, you will also be asked to complete short questionnaires about your
      experience.</li>
    <li>Data from the tasks and the questionnaires will be recorded by the study system.</li>
    <li>No audio or video will be recorded during the session.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Funded by:</b> The Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.</p>
  <p><b>Potential Risks:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>There are no known or anticipated risks to you by participating in this specific research project.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Potential Benefits:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li> The main benefit to you is helping to improve understanding of the challenges of visual comparison and the
      potential benefits of introducing new techniques into the space.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Confidentiality:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>The data collected from this study will be used in articles for publication in journals and conference
      proceedings.</li>

      not be associated with the data gathered, and data will be reported in aggregate form so that it will not be
      possible to identify individuals. For any presentation of comments, confidentiality will be preserved by using
      participant ID numbers.</li>
    <li>Consent forms will be stored separately from the data so that it will not be possible to associate a name with
      any given set of responses. The informed consent form and all research data will be kept in a secure and
      confidential location, in accordance with University policy, for 10 years. After this period, all data will be
      deleted beyond recovery.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p><b>Right to Withdraw:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Your participation is voluntary and you can answer only those questions that you
      are comfortable with. You may withdraw from the research project for any reason, at
      any time without explanation or penalty of any sort, including the offered remuneration.</li>
    <li>Should you wish to withdraw during the study session, you can email
      the experimenters to be considered for partial payment. If you wish to
      withdraw after the study, send an email to the experimenters. Your data
      will be deleted from the study and all records of your participation will
      be destroyed. Note that at a certain point, data will have been
      aggregated and presented in publications, and at this point it will no
      longer be possible to remove your data from the study.</li>
    <li>Whether you choose to participate or not will not be used in any rating
      or feedback given on any crowdsource platform.</li>
    <li>Your right to withdraw data from the study will apply until data has
      been aggregated and presented in publications (typically three months
      after the completion of the study); at this point it will no longer be possible to remove your data from the
      study.</li>
