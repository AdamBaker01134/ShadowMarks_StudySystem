<br />
This task has 2 comparison trials. For each trial, 6 Arctic sea ice videos will load in for you to view and compare.
Your task is to find between 1 and 3 videos where the ice extends past the vertical halfway line between the two
islands circled in Figure 1.
<br /><br />
Imagine there is a line between the middle of the top island and the bottom island. Play through all the videos and look for between 1 and 3 videos
where ice (light blue and white) extends past this line.
