<h1>Shadow Marks</h1>

A <b>Shadow Mark</b> is an object that can be placed in one display, and will be <i>shadowed</i> (or mirrored) in all other displays at the same location.
An example Shadow Mark is the red cursor visible in all of the scatterplots of Figure 1.

<br />
<br />
<div class="fig">
    <img src="{{url_for('my_task.static', filename = 'assets/instructions/task4/shadowmarkers_description_img1.webp')}}" alt="Shadow Marks image"/>
    <small><b>Fig.1.</b> Example of a Shadow Mark placed within a scatterplot and shadowed in all other plots.</small>
</div>
<br />
<br />

In this example, the user positions a <b>Cursor</b> Shadow Mark at the highest outlier in the second scatterplot by hovering within the display.
The system duplicates the cursor lines at the same location in all the other images. Now the user can compare the heights of all the data by
observing which points are above or below the line.
