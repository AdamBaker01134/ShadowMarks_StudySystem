<br />
This task has 2 comparison trials. For each trial, 6 Arctic sea ice videos will load in for you to view and compare.
Your task is to find any videos where the ice extends into the rectangular area highlighted in Figure 1.

<br />
First, make a mark to encapsulte the area of interest (using either the rectangle, line, or freeform tool) like in Figure 2. Then,
play through all the videos and look for any videos where ice (light blue and white) extends into the marked region.
Select all videos where this happens.
