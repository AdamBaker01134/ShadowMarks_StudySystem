<h1>Shadow Marks</h1>

A <b>Shadow Mark</b> is an object that can be placed in one display, and will be <i>shadowed</i> (or mirrored) in all other displays at the same location.
An example Shadow Mark is the red cursor visible in all of the videos of Figure 1.

<br />
<br />
<div class="fig">
    <img src="{{url_for('my_task.static', filename = 'assets/instructions/task2/shadowmarkers_description_img1.webp')}}" alt="Shadow Marks image"/>
    <small><b>Fig.1.</b> Example of a Cursor Shadow Mark placed within an Arctic ice video and shadowed in all other videos.</small>
</div>
<br />
<br />

In this example, the user has placed a <b>Cursor</b> Shadow Mark at the rightmost edge of the ice.
The system duplicates the lines at the same location in all the other videos. Now the user can compare the ice extent of all the videos by
observing which videos extend to the right past the vertical line.

<br /><br />
You can play through the videos by pressing <b>SPACEBAR</b>, or by dragging the scrollbar located at the bottom of the page.
Watch frame by frame by tapping the <b>LEFT ARROW</b> or the <b>RIGHT ARROW</b>.
<br /><br />
You can also zoom in by holding <b>CONTROL</b> and pressing the <b>+</b> key, and zoom out by holding <b>CONTROL</b> and pressing the <b>-</b> key.
