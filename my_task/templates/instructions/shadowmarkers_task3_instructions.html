    <small><b>Fig.1.</b> Example of performing shadow mark comparison on 6 baseball pitching videos in <b>marker</b> mode. Find between 1 and 3 videos where the release point is close to the release point of the pitcher in the top left-hand corner (highlighted in red).</small>
</div>
<br />
<b>Description</b>: This task has 2 comparison trials. For each trial, 6 baseball pitching videos will load in for you to view and compare.
Your task is to find between 1 and 3 videos where the pitcher's release point (location of the ball in the first frame the ball is in flight) is close to
the release point of the pitcher in the top left-hand corner (highlighted in red in Figure 1 & 2).
<br /><br />
<b>Steps</b>: Play through the top left video until the pitcher releases the ball. Add a mark at this location. You can use any mark you like, but we recommend using the marker
(as in Figure 1). Once your release point is marked, play through the other videos and check to see if their release points are close to
your mark. Select between 1 and 3 videos where it is close.
<br /><br />
<b>Note</b>: "close" means within the length of the pitchers head.
<br /><br />
<b>Reminder</b>: Select a video by holding <b>CONTROL</b> and clicking on it.
