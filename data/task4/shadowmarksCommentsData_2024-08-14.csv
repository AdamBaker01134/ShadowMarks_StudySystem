24,overlays_smallmultiples_shadowmarks,"I'm not sure if I've missed a screen size requirement, but it was almost impossible to see anything on the overlay exercise. As soon as I added more than 1 overlay, the preview screen, which was about 1.5 inch wide, trying to display outliers smaller than the pixel size on my screen, and getting 50% dimmer with each overlay being added... It was ridiculous. I tried to zoom as the instructions mentioned, but it only zoomed the selections, not the preview area."
