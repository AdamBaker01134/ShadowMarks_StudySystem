21,overlays_shadowmarks_smallmultiples,preference,Overlays,It was the fastest I can finish the task
22,shadowmarks_smallmultiples_overlays,speed,Shadow Marks,It was easier having a grid to help measure the plants.
22,shadowmarks_smallmultiples_overlays,accuracy,Shadow Marks,The red lines really kelped.
22,shadowmarks_smallmultiples_overlays,preference,Shadow Marks,It was the easiest.
24,shadowmarks_overlays_smallmultiples,speed,Shadow Marks,This technique allows me to compare all of the plants at the same time by looking at the horizontal line.

26,smallmultiples_shadowmarks_overlays,speed,Overlays,It was the quickest to compare the images
26,smallmultiples_shadowmarks_overlays,accuracy,Overlays,it was the easiest
26,smallmultiples_shadowmarks_overlays,preference,Overlays,It was the most straight forward
27,shadowmarks_overlays_smallmultiples,speed,Small Multiples,It broke up the comparison into smaller parts
27,shadowmarks_overlays_smallmultiples,accuracy,Shadow Marks,You could see for sure whether a plant was higher than the last mark
27,shadowmarks_overlays_smallmultiples,preference,Overlays,It felt like it required the least effort
28,smallmultiples_overlays_shadowmarks,speed,Overlays,"It required less precision than the shadow marks, and the small multiples required too much guess work so it took longer because I kept getting it wrong."
28,smallmultiples_overlays_shadowmarks,accuracy,Shadow Marks,"This technique was most helpful for me as it provided me with a visual, unmoving border to compare each sunflower to, instead of trying to picture it in my head, I think my depth perception is worse at the top and bottom of my vision instead of in the middle so I could never tell if the distances were the same or not."
28,smallmultiples_overlays_shadowmarks,preference,Shadow Marks,"Once I got past the difficulty of learning the task and realised the flowers were growing at different paces and had different peaks, it was easiest to compare the sunflowers with these guided lines that did all the distance measuring for me"
31,overlays_shadowmarks_smallmultiples,speed,Shadow Marks,The line across all the flowers was these easiest as it was able to clearly show whether the other flowers were below or above it 
31,overlays_shadowmarks_smallmultiples,accuracy,Shadow Marks,Due to the lines being in red I could clearly see what plants measured up to others 
31,overlays_shadowmarks_smallmultiples,preference,Shadow Marks,This was the easist and quickest and least hard to understand the technique 
35,overlays_shadowmarks_smallmultiples,speed,Shadow Marks,helped to see the marker line
35,overlays_shadowmarks_smallmultiples,accuracy,Overlays,showed comparison
35,overlays_shadowmarks_smallmultiples,preference,Shadow Marks,fastest/easiest
36,smallmultiples_overlays_shadowmarks,speed,Shadow Marks,It felt a lot easier to keep track of the tallest by simply moving the grid to the highest point of one and then checking the others
36,smallmultiples_overlays_shadowmarks,accuracy,Shadow Marks,"The grid made it easier to pin point the actual height and keep track, so it was more accurate however the last take i struggled with due to them all being so similar in height so im not sure if my results will match this opinion"
36,smallmultiples_overlays_shadowmarks,preference,Shadow Marks,It was the quickest to use and easiest to see clearly 
39,smallmultiples_overlays_shadowmarks,speed,Shadow Marks,Quick to easily detect
39,smallmultiples_overlays_shadowmarks,accuracy,Shadow Marks,The grid lines were easy to use
39,smallmultiples_overlays_shadowmarks,preference,Shadow Marks,Really straightforward
40,smallmultiples_shadowmarks_overlays,speed,Shadow Marks,the cursor help way better for me 
40,smallmultiples_shadowmarks_overlays,accuracy,Shadow Marks,was easy to visualize 
40,smallmultiples_shadowmarks_overlays,preference,Shadow Marks,faster 
45,overlays_smallmultiples_shadowmarks,speed,Shadow Marks,I was able to measure the high of each flower with the shadow mark.
45,overlays_smallmultiples_shadowmarks,accuracy,Shadow Marks,It was a precise method.
45,overlays_smallmultiples_shadowmarks,preference,Shadow Marks,It made the task easy for me.
47,overlays_shadowmarks_smallmultiples,speed,Shadow Marks,I could mark the one in the first row that I thought was the tallest and then just watch row 2 and 3 to see if any of those passed the mark.
47,overlays_shadowmarks_smallmultiples,accuracy,Shadow Marks,Without the shadow marks you couldn't tell the exact height on the rest of the rows.
47,overlays_shadowmarks_smallmultiples,preference,Shadow Marks,It took less time and I was able to get a more accurate idea of the height when comparing with the shadow mark.
52,overlays_shadowmarks_smallmultiples,speed,Overlays,"BY playing the videos over each other, it was easier to find the accurate answer."
52,overlays_shadowmarks_smallmultiples,accuracy,Small Multiples,by placing the shadow marks i could see accurately how each flower measured against the other.
52,overlays_shadowmarks_smallmultiples,preference,Shadow Marks,It provided the most accurate results.

57,overlays_smallmultiples_shadowmarks,speed,Shadow Marks,I didn't have to do it over multiple times or keep guessing.
57,overlays_smallmultiples_shadowmarks,accuracy,Shadow Marks,The lines were there to keep comparing as the plants changed.
57,overlays_smallmultiples_shadowmarks,preference,Shadow Marks,It's easier
60,overlays_shadowmarks_smallmultiples,speed,Shadow Marks,Its the fastest because I could just select a shadow mark of one flow at its highest height. Then skim through others to see who passed the line highest.
60,overlays_shadowmarks_smallmultiples,accuracy,Shadow Marks,I think its the most accurate because it seemed like I had a ruler to use for compare each of the 9 videos.
60,overlays_shadowmarks_smallmultiples,preference,Shadow Marks,I would prefer this technique because you have a direct comparison of each of the nine boxes at their same relative squares like you do with a ruler.
62,shadowmarks_overlays_smallmultiples,speed,Small Multiples,Because it's basically guess work. I don't really need to view the video. The all look just as tall. I could just quickly perform trial and error to find the answers.
62,shadowmarks_overlays_smallmultiples,accuracy,Shadow Marks,I could compare plants purely based on their highest points. I wouldn't be affected by when they become mature and have decline in their lifecycle that would affect their heights.
62,shadowmarks_overlays_smallmultiples,preference,Shadow Marks,It's the most accurate.
65,overlays_shadowmarks_smallmultiples,speed,Overlays,it was easier to compare the heights when all the plants were on top of each other

65,overlays_shadowmarks_smallmultiples,preference,Overlays,it was the easiest
66,shadowmarks_overlays_smallmultiples,speed,Shadow Marks,"It was easiest to compare all heights of flowers over different points in time, since the flowers did not grow at the same rate."
66,shadowmarks_overlays_smallmultiples,accuracy,Overlays,"I was able to compare the heights directly between two flowers, but I still felt as though I was using a lot of mental effort and guessing at some poitns."
66,shadowmarks_overlays_smallmultiples,preference,Overlays,"This was the easiest to learn and felt the most accurate, even though in actuality I performed better in the overlay task (since I did not make any mistakes). "

67,shadowmarks_overlays_smallmultiples,accuracy,Small Multiples,Greater ability to view both stages 
67,shadowmarks_overlays_smallmultiples,preference,Small Multiples,Small multiples was by far the easiest for me to use
75,shadowmarks_smallmultiples_overlays,speed,Shadow Marks,It was easier to make comparisons.
75,shadowmarks_smallmultiples_overlays,accuracy,Shadow Marks,I could easily check if it crossed the line.
75,shadowmarks_smallmultiples_overlays,preference,Shadow Marks,It was the easiest to check nine samples at the same time.
