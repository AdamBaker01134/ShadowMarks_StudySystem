24,shadowmarks_overlays_smallmultiples,Some of the trials wouldn't load and I had to keep refreshing the page. It has taken me way longer than it should have. I have worked hard to complete the study. I hope there are no issues. Best regards.

I found it hard to complete as it messed with my keyboard a lot and one of the pages kept opening in a new tab, so I had to go out of full-screen mode into a new tab and then it wouldn't let me go back into full-screen mode, it bugged my keyboard out and I had to restart my PC twice."
